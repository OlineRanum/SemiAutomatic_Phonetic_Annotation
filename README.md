# 3D-LEX Semi-Automatic Annotation of Phonemes in Sign Language

This repository contains the code to perform semi-autmatic annotations of phonetic properties based on the 3D-LEX dataset, and to reproduce the results of the paper: _3D-LEX v1.0: 3D Lexicons for American Sign Language and Sign Language of the Netherlands_.

Currently available phoneme classes: 

    - Handshapes

## Setup

### Datasets
#### 3D-LEX

#### Evaluation: WLASL & SemLEX
Evaluations of new phonetic labels are currently available with WLASL 2000 ISLR benchmark (Li et al., 2020), which has been combinet with the phonological annotations in ASL-LEX 2.0 (Sehyr et al., 2021) in Kezar et al., 2023. Please obtain the metadata for the merged ASL-LEX and WLASL benchmark from the original repository [https://github.com/leekezar/Modeling-ASL-Phonology/tree/main/training_data](Kezar et al., 2023). 

Evaluations on SemLEX will be available soon.
